# Timeboxing
I saw an Instagram reel as a lot of other people must have seen about how Harvard tested many different ways of productivity for students and the one that stood out from all of them was this one: Timeboxing.


[here's the Wikipedia link to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)

I've personally used it and it has been useful in finding your immediate goals in a day and orginizing your thoughts at the start of the day.

Again just like any other productivity tool it is the person that has to do the work, all this does is provide a way to see your day in a more clearer manner.

## Summary of timeboxing
1. you brain dump in the brain dumping section. (pour everything you have to do in your brain on the paper)
2. then you choose your top priorities for the day.
3. then we timebox. (allocate specific times for each goal)

## Usage of the web app
the web app has all of these sections.
1. you can brain dump then either highlight one line or word to turn it into a task or just hit the `Create Task From Seclection` button to turn each line into a task
2. then choose your top priorities and write them in the 3 sections
3. then we can drag the tasks and top priorities into the timeboxing area 
4. the time boxing area has been divided into 30 minute sections so for example we can put 3 of the same tasks back to back if we want to do something for one and a half hours
5. you can then print it or have it saved on your browser history
*i don't have the funds for a server to run this on so no user history or any type of account*
**but on the bright side i can't steal your data** üëçüëç
