# what to do when civilizations have been destroyed and our children discover our wrong doings
there are some very interesting entries on Wikipedia about secret projects from US airforces like project [rods from god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment) or [list of unusual deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_deaths) if you're bored you can check list of lists of lists on Wikipedia, there are plenty of stuff you can find.

there is one i particularly enjoyed reading however:[long term nuclear warning messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages)

it discusses that in a possible (possibly near) future where war or other events have occurred and the civilization of humanity has been destroyed to the point that humanity has lost the ability to read the current languages, how would we communicate the danger of nuclear waste and its effects.

nuclear waste is usually buried underground, so the ground above has the capacity to store various types of infrastructure that make humans feel anxious and make them leave that area; infrastructure like spikes made of concrete, blackened ground, or buildings that make tones that would make humans feel afraid.

the part that I liked was that in case language and writing weren't lost to humanity certain messages were to be written on placks on concrete poles going deep into the ground. here are some proposed messages:


>This place is a message... and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it!

>Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.

>This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.

>What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.

>The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a particular size and shape, and below us.

>The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.

>The danger is to the body, and it can kill.

>The form of the danger is an emanation of energy.

>The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.


especially the part that says "This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here." this is very ominous and gives a very solemn feeling as if the people writing these (which were probably the same people who had hands in creating the waste) were regretful of what they had done.
