# Thank you letter to carykh
there was this video made by carykh on 21 Farvardin of 1398  called [automatic on-the-fly video editing tool!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ8orIurGxw) and in it, he explained that he had to watch too many video lectures and he didn't have enough time to get through them so he and his friends noticed that a lot of the time in the video was spent by the professor cleaning the board, walking around the class or just not doing anything so they made this python script that cuts out the silent part in the video (or makes the silent parts faster) so that the overall time of the lecture is reduced. link to the project GitHub page below
[jumpcutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ8orIurGxw)

the script left a lot to be desired as it wasn't very optimized and jump-cutting one video almost filled my C drive, but the idea was very interesting.
in fact so interesting that after that video 3 different companies (that I have seen) took the idea and made it their own some of them are Wondershare, timebolt, ... 
timebolt guy really pissed me off, it is one thing to take an idea and make it better but he was trying to sell his "video editing tool" for a very high price. (17$ a month at the time of writing, also subscription-based?)
for something that has a free alternative, this felt very shitty. also, I didn't like the guy.

carykh however went on to make his own version of jumpcutter and with the help of his friends, he made a cloud-based video editing tool that does what jumpcutter did better and also with new functionality. (this one was also too expensive for me :( (6$ a month, still better than the timebolt guy) )

so the open-source community was left with a couple of guys like me who didn't know what we were doing, a couple of people tried to make a better version but didn't succeed.

this was until I found what I had been looking for all this time an MPV plugin that did all of this in real time and with no problems.
this is the GitHub issue that started it and the gut in there also talks about the carykh video. [issue](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/6797)

and this is one of the plugins that do what I want [mpv-skipsilence](https://github.com/ferreum/mpv-skipsilence)      
apparently, there are a lot of other projects that do the same thing.    
Premier plugins, an option on NewPipe to skip silences, and a Chrome extension that does this on videos on the browser.    
this is a lot better than setting a video you want to watch to start rendering and then watching it.

it's really interesting how one YouTube video that only has 724k views (at the time of my writing this) could bring change to other video editing softwares and also the way people watch their videos.

so thank you Cary you have saved me days of headaches at university not having to spend too much time listening to mind-numbing lectures.♥‿♥


sometimes this tool made a lecture that takes 3 hours into something I can finish in 45 minutes (with increased video speed), I wish I had something like this sooner.(╥﹏╥)
