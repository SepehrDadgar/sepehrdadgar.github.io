# Restoring an old mil
A mil is an old piece of exercise equipment in the championship sports (`zoorkhane`) in Iran.

the mil was cracked and water damaged, four years ago I made some wood filler with wood dust and wood glue and that sealed the biggest cracks.
then i let it sit for 4 years.

recently my small mil has become too light for me so i finally decided to finish this restoration.

then i added filler to the smaller cracks then sanded the filler off (image not included)

i then painted it with this water based acrylic paint

then i added a clear coat on top of the paint
>the first time i was laying on the clear coat i didn't know that i was supposed to thin it down so the right one looks way shinier i later added another coating of clear coat to the other one so they are more even
>i thinned it down using an oiled based paint thinner

i added some bote jeghe [wikipedia link for bote jeghe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley_(design)) decals and added a layer of clear coat on top so that it stays for longer
and this is the final result!
