first impressions really matter, as an Iranian person who has never left his country I haven't really experienced other cultures for myself; all the impressions I've had are based on what I've read, heard or watched.

when I was in English class and I was learning new words about different kinds of foods there are, as an example of Asian food they gave us *tofu* and the whole thing was a couple of Western kids talking about how they hate tofu and how bad it is so I also having no other reference point was disgusted by tofu
(these were Longman books to be precise, good books though)

recently I thought about this, the closest piece of tofu is probably thousands of kilometers away from me maybe in an eastern-asian supermarket in Tehran because there sure as hell aren't such supermarkets in Shiraz.

so maybe tofu is actually good, what do those white kids in my English textbook know.

also, there may be other things that I've made premature impressions about. and not just things, but people too.
