# watch back cover, i need a 3D printer
I got an old Gloria watch from my grandfather, he actually gave me a choice between a new cheap watch and an old beaten up slightly better watch; I don't think he was expecting me to take the old one however I did.

I like the watch, it has a night-day indicator and it shows the date and day of the week and it does it mechanically.    
but the watch doesn't have a back cover and when I got it it had a back cover from a different watch that didn't match it.

so I went to an old watch repair shop that my mom used to visit as a child and I asked the repairman who has a shaking hand after suffering from an aneurism to find me a back cover and after fiddling with the watch and trying different back covers from different watches he through his hands in the air and said he couldn't find me something that fits.

I had expected this, back covers don't really follow a standard the only ways was to make one my self    
since I had taken a 3D modeling class in uni I declared this task to be easy and made myself a back cover and even etched my initials into it.

now today after waiting for the 3 by 3 cm part to be finished (T_T) turns out it doesn't fit. so I just filed the part down kind of jammed it in there and it works.

moral of the story is: if I had a 3D printer at home I wouldn't be so down right now even though i "finished" what I set out to do. (⌐■_■)   
I want to pull out my hair right now
